<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Josh!</h1>

I like making software, particularly with [the Julia language](https://julialang.org).

## About Me

- I'm a Senior Research Scientist at [Julia Computing](https://juliacomputing.com) where I primarily do scientific software/data science R&D for government customers.
- I do a lot of [open source development](https://github.com/joshday).
- I am the creator and main contributor to the [Julia for Data Science](https://www.juliafordatascience.com) newsletter.

- I have a PhD in Statistics from NC State.  My research into on-line algorithms for statistics led to the development of the [OnlineStats](https://github.com/joshday/OnlineStats.jl) Julia package.
