# Joshua Day, PhD

My name is Josh. I work on all things technical/scientific computing, but my niche is the intersection of statistics and computer science. I'm good at solving problems and then converting whiteboard math into efficient programs. [Julia](https://julialang.org) is my favorite language. I obsess over two things in my projects: 1) Performance, and 2) Usability.


## About Me

- I'm a Senior Research Scientist at [JuliaHub](https://juliahub.com) where I primarily do scientific software/data science R&D for government customers.
- I do a lot of [open source development](https://github.com/joshday).
- I am the creator and main contributor to the [Julia for Data Science](https://www.juliafordatascience.com) newsletter.
- I have a PhD in Statistics from NC State.  My research into on-line algorithms for statistics led to the development of the [OnlineStats](https://github.com/joshday/OnlineStats.jl) Julia package.

## Things I've Built

- [**OnlineStats.jl**](https://github.com/joshday/OnlineStats.jl): Single-pass algorithms for statistics and data viz with big data.
- [**PlotlyLight.jl**](https://github.com/JuliaComputing/PlotlyLight.jl): Lightweight, easy-to-use wrapper of the fantastic [Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/) plotting library.
- [**XML.jl**](https://github.com/JuliaComputing/XML.jl): An XML reader/writer in pure Julia that performs comparably to implementations in C.
- [**Cobweb.jl**](https://github.com/JuliaComputing/Cobweb.jl): An HTML reader/writer in pure Julia that's fast and easy to use.
- [**One Click Tuner**](https://oneclicktuner.com): iOS app with a chromatic musical instrument tuner.
- [**XKCD.jl**](https://github.com/joshday/XKCD.jl): Retrieve image and metadata from the XKCD webcomic.
- [**TokenIterators.jl**](https://github.com/joshday/TokenIterators.jl): Fast framework for writing lexers/tokenizers.
- [**DepotDelivery.jl**](https://github.com/JuliaComputing/DepotDelivery.jl): Create a standalone Julia depot that can be used in air-gapped deploymet.
- [**And much more...**](https://github.com/joshday?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=&sort=stargazers)
